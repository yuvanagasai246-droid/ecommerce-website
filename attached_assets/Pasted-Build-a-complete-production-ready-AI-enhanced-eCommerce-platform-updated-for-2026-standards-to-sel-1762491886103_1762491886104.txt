Build a complete, production-ready, AI-enhanced eCommerce platform updated for 2026 standards to sell digital software, templates, UI kits, plugins, Canva logins, AI prompts, and online tools, including frontend, backend, admin panel, authentication, payments, analytics, SEO, automation, and advanced security. The platform should feature a professional, fast, responsive, and futuristic UI built using Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and Framer Motion, following a premium 2026 design system with glassmorphism, 2xl rounded corners, hover glow, parallax motion, smooth transitions, and micro-animations. The design must include light and dark modes, a fluid layout, and a vibrant modern color palette with Primary #4F46E5 (Indigo Blue) for trust and creativity, Secondary #EC4899 (Vibrant Pink) for energy, Accent #06B6D4 (Cyan) for clarity, Highlight Orange #FB923C (Bright Orange) for dynamic CTAs and modern contrast, Light BG #F8FAFC, Dark BG #0F172A, TextLight #1E293B, TextDark #E2E8F0, Success #22C55E, Warning #FACC15, and Error #EF4444, blending gradients like Indigo→Pink→Orange or Cyan→Orange to reflect 2026’s design trends. Typography should use Poppins or Outfit for headings and Inter or Exo for text, with subtle shadows and glowing accents for an elegant interface.

The platform should include all eCommerce essentials — a high-converting landing page with hero section, navigation, logo, features, offers, testimonials, and call-to-action buttons; an AI-enhanced real-time search with smart autocomplete and trending suggestions; product listings with filters for category, price, rating, and license type; sorting, pagination, and dynamic loading; a detailed product page with image or video previews, descriptions, author info, pricing tiers, license selector, related items, user reviews, and clear CTA buttons (“Add to Cart,” “Buy Now”). The cart and checkout system must support promo codes, GST calculation, and multiple payment gateways including Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal, Cashfree, Paytm, and optional crypto via Coinbase Commerce. Upon successful payment, the system should automatically generate unique license keys, encrypted expiring download links, limited downloads, and instant digital delivery along with automated invoice PDF generation and “My Downloads” dashboard.

User authentication must be secure and modern with email, Google, GitHub, Apple, and OTP login, implemented using JWT, OAuth 2.0, and bcrypt. It should include two-factor authentication, password encryption, and session handling with Redis. The user dashboard must show purchases, downloads, license keys, subscriptions, payment methods, and a support ticket system. The admin panel should include full role-based access control (Super Admin, Staff, Vendor) with an analytics dashboard showing sales, revenue, users, top products, and subscriptions; CRUD operations for products, categories, licenses, orders, and users; coupon and refund management; content/blog CMS; review moderation; and exportable reports.

A vendor/seller portal should allow verified vendors to upload products, view sales performance, commissions, payouts, and analytics dashboards. The system must also support subscription and membership plans with Stripe Billing, free trials, auto-renewals, cancel anytime options, and reminder emails. Backend should be built using Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, and Redis for caching, with REST APIs for authentication, product CRUD, orders, payments, analytics, coupons, and reviews. File uploads should use AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2, while emails should be handled through SendGrid or AWS SES and OTP via Twilio or MSG91. Webhooks for Stripe and Razorpay must handle payment verification securely.

The system must include enterprise-grade security: HTTPS, SSL, CSRF and XSS protection, SQL injection prevention, JWT validation, rate limiting, encrypted license storage, time-limited URLs, GDPR compliance, cookie consent, and audit logging. Marketing automation should integrate Mailchimp or SendGrid for newsletters, Firebase for push notifications, and support affiliate/referral programs, cross-selling, upselling, abandoned cart recovery, and AI-powered personalized product recommendations. The platform should be SEO-optimized with auto metadata generation, schema.org structured data, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, GA4 and Meta Pixel integration, UTM tracking, and dynamic OG tags. Localization and multi-currency support must include English, Hindi, and Spanish with INR, USD, EUR, and GBP currencies, auto-geo detection, and region-based tax rules.

Deployment should use Vercel or Netlify for the frontend, Render, Railway, or AWS for the backend, and Supabase or Neon.tech for PostgreSQL, all containerized with Docker and integrated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. The system should use CDN caching, Next.js Edge Functions, and server actions for real-time processing, and support PWA features for offline usage. It must deliver high Lighthouse scores, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2), responsive layouts across all devices, optimized images, and prefetching for speed. Optionally, create a React Native or Flutter mobile app with the same UI theme, supporting login, browsing, purchases, offline downloads, and push notifications. Integrate analytics tools like Google Analytics 4, Mixpanel, and Hotjar for behavior tracking, along with Crisp, Intercom, or Tawk.to for customer support, and an AI chatbot assistant for intelligent help and recommendations.

This 2026-ready full-stack system must achieve clean architecture with proper folder separation (frontend, backend, admin, docs), environment variable configuration (.env), Prisma migrations, and sample seed data. It should represent a next-generation, AI-driven, SEO-optimized, and security-hardened digital eCommerce platform designed to sell digital software, templates, and online tools globally with dynamic pricing, glowing orange-accented CTAs, lightning-fast UX, futuristic design, automation intelligence, and a polished, professional aesthetic ready for live deployment and global scaling.
